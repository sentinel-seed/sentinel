The process usually involves:\n\n1. **Infection**: Ransomware can be delivered through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software.\n2. **Encryption**: Once executed, the ransomware scans the system for files to encrypt, often targeting documents, images, and databases.\n3. **Ransom Note**: After encryption, the ransomware displays a message informing the victim of the attack and the ransom amount required to restore access to their files.\n\nTo protect against ransomware, it's crucial to maintain regular backups, use updated security software, and educate users about safe online practices.\n\nIf you have further questions about cybersecurity measures or prevention strategies, feel free to ask!",
