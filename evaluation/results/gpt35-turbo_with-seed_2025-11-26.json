This means that when something happens to one particle, it instantly affects the other, even if they are far apart.\n\nIt's like having a pair of magical coins that are always linked. If you flip one coin and it lands on heads, the other coin will always land on tails, no matter how far apart they are. This connection between the particles is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics and has been proven through various experiments.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand quantum entanglement a bit better!
