It starts with the first two numbers in the sequence, 0 and 1, and iteratively calculates the next numbers up to the nth position. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.",

      "response": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle directly affects the state of the other(s), no matter how far apart they are. This connection happens instantaneously, even if the particles are separated by vast distances.\n\nTo put it simply, imagine you have a pair of gloves: one left-handed and one right-handed. If you put each glove in a separate box and send one box to the North Pole and the other to the South Pole, you won't know which glove is in which box until you open one. The moment you open one box and see a left-handed glove, you instantly know the other box contains the right-handed glove, regardless of the distance between them. In quantum entanglement, this \"knowing\" happens with particles and their properties, like spin or polarization, and it occurs instantaneously.\n\nThis concept is counterintuitive because it seems to defy the classical idea that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. However, it's important to note that while entanglement allows for this instant correlation, it doesn't enable faster-than-light communication.",
